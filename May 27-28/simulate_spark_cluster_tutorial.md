# 🔧 Tutorial: Simulating a Spark Cluster and Exploring Job, Task, MapReduce Internals

This tutorial guides you through simulating a local Spark cluster, observing how Spark distributes jobs, stages, and tasks, and how it handles operations similar to MapReduce.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Simulate a Spark cluster on your machine
- Understand how Spark splits jobs into stages and tasks
- Observe how map and reduce operations are executed in parallel
- Analyze execution via the Spark UI

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Spark and PySpark installed
- Basic Python and Spark knowledge
- Web browser to access Spark UI

---

## 🔄 Step 1: Simulate a Cluster Locally

In Spark, you can simulate a cluster by setting `local[*]`, where `*` means Spark will use all cores available.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder     .appName("ClusterSimulation")     .master("local[4]") \  # Simulate 4 cores
    .getOrCreate()
```

This launches a local Spark environment with 4 worker threads acting as executors.

---

## 📦 Step 2: Sample Dataset

We'll generate a synthetic dataset of key-value pairs to mimic MapReduce operations.

```python
import random

data = [(random.randint(1, 100), 1) for _ in range(100000)]
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data, 8)  # 8 partitions
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 3: Apply Map and Reduce Operations

```python
# Map step: Already in (key, 1) format
# Reduce step: Sum values per key
reduced = rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)
reduced.collect()
```

---

## 📈 Step 4: Observe Spark UI

While the job is running, open the Spark UI at:

```
http://localhost:4040
```

### Explore:

- **Jobs Tab**: View DAG and number of stages.
- **Stages Tab**: How tasks are distributed across stages.
- **Tasks Tab**: Duration, executor info.
- **Executors Tab**: Parallelism and memory usage.

---

## 🔍 Internals Breakdown

### 🗃️ Job → Stage → Task

- **Job**: Triggered by an action (e.g., `.collect()`)
- **Stage**: Boundaries at shuffles (e.g., `reduceByKey`)
- **Task**: A unit of work on a data partition

Example:
- `parallelize()` creates 8 partitions → 8 tasks
- `reduceByKey()` causes a shuffle → new stage

### 🧮 Map and Reduce in Spark

- **Map**: `flatMap`, `map`, `filter`, etc. – per record, parallel
- **Reduce**: `reduceByKey`, `aggregateByKey`, etc. – involves shuffling data

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Add Delays to Observe Task Behavior

```python
import time

def delayed_map(record):
    time.sleep(0.001)  # artificial delay
    return record

rdd_delayed = rdd.map(delayed_map)
rdd_delayed.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a + b).collect()
```

Check the **Tasks** tab again for changes in task durations.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Spark simulates a cluster using `local[N]` mode for testing
- Map operations run before shuffle, reduce runs after
- Spark UI gives insights into parallel execution and bottlenecks

---

## 📘 Optional: Try with `local-cluster` Mode (Advanced)

To simulate a more realistic cluster:

```bash
$ spark-shell --master local-cluster[2, 1, 1024]
```

- 2 workers, 1 core each, 1GB memory
- Can run Spark jobs to test executor behavior

---

## 📌 Cleanup

```python
spark.stop()
```

üìö Tasks: Collaborative Plagiarism Detection Dataset Creation

üß† Objective:

Create a labeled dataset for training and testing plagiarism detection algorithms. Students will collaboratively author original and plagiarized short paragraphs in response to Big Data Analytics questions, simulating different types and levels of plagiarism.

üîç Overview:

You will work individually to:

    Write multiple original answers to assigned Big Data Analytics questions.

    Create two levels of plagiarized versions of these answers:

        Level 1 (Light Plagiarism): Paraphrased with partial copying and rephrasing.

        Level 2 (Heavy Plagiarism): Copying most of the structure/phrasing with minimal change.

The goal is to generate a realistic, labeled dataset of short text samples for future use in training and testing document similarity and plagiarism detection algorithms such as shingling, MinHashing, and LSH.


üèóÔ∏è Dataset Structure:

Each data record should include:

    question_id: ID of the question.

    author_id: student ID (for tracking).

    text: Answer content (at most 400 words. Ideally few paragraphs.).

    label: One of original, plagiarized_light, or plagiarized_heavy.

    source_answer_id: If plagiarized, reference the original answer‚Äôs ID.

üõ§Ô∏è Milestones:

üîπ Milestone 1: Question Pool Creation (Already done for you)

    Following conceptual questions related to Big Data Analytics topics (e.g., Hadoop architecture, MapReduce, Spark, Finding Similar Items, Vector Representation, Set Representation, Jaccard Similarity, Cosine Similarity).
        
        Q1: What is the cosine similarity metric, and why is it commonly used in text similarity tasks? Provide an example calculation.
        Q2: How are documents represented in the vector space model? Explain the role of TF-IDF in weighting terms.
        Q3: Define Jaccard similarity. How is it different from cosine similarity? Provide an example where Jaccard similarity is more appropriate than cosine similarity.
        Q4: What is the role of shingling in document similarity detection?
        Q5: Explain the concept of MinHashing and how it approximates the Jaccard similarity between two sets. Provide a simple example.


üîπ Milestone 2: Original Answer Generation

Due Tuesday (Next Class)

    Each student writes two different original answers per question.

        These must differ significantly in wording, tone, structure, and examples.

        Should not be copied from any existing source or peer.

    Mark these as label = original.

‚úÖ Goal: ~10-15 high-quality original answers in total.

{
  "question_id": "Q2",
  "author_id": "S23",
  "text": "Streaming processing allows...",
  "label": "original",
  "source_answer_id": ""
}

Please create a text file in the above format.

üîπ Milestone 3: Plagiarism Simulation

Due Friday (One Week from today)

Each student chooses 2 original answers written by a peer (assigned by instructor) and creates:

    Level 1 Plagiarized Version

        Use partial rewording, sentence shuffling, synonym replacement.

        The structure and key phrases may still be recognizable.

    Level 2 Plagiarized Version

        Minimal modification of the original.

        Slight changes like removing/replacing adjectives, passive ‚Üî active voice, slight word substitutions.

    Properly fill the source_answer_id and label fields.

    Reflection report (1 page per Student):

        How you approached creating realistic plagiarism

        Challenges in simulating different levels

        Suggestions for using the dataset in model training
{
  "question_id": "Q2",
  "author_id": "S23",
  "text": "Streaming processing allows...",
  "label": "plagiarized_light",
  "source_answer_id": "A12"
}


‚úÖ Goal: ~10-15 plagiarized paragraphs generated by the class.


üîπ Milestone 4: Consolidation and Review

    Class-wide QA check to identify:

        Duplicates

        Inaccurate labels

        Poor-quality or inconsistent plagiarism simulation

    Final dataset merged into a structured CSV/JSON file format with fields:


‚úÖ Final Deliverable: A clean dataset with ~50-80 samples.




üìå Instructions for Students:

    Use respectful, academic tone in all answers.

    Avoid any external copying from the web or textbooks.

    Use different writing styles (technical, explanatory, analogical).

    For plagiarism simulation, make the imitation subtle but deliberate.

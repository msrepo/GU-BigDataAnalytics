Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is widely used in various domains where approximate similarity search or clustering is required. Here are some key applications:

1. Near-Duplicate Detection
Use Case: Detecting duplicate or near-duplicate documents, images, or videos.
Example: Identifying similar web pages in search engines to avoid showing duplicate results.
2. Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search
Use Case: Finding approximate nearest neighbors in high-dimensional data.
Example: Recommender systems, where similar users or items are identified based on feature vectors.

3. Plagiarism Detection
Use Case: Detecting plagiarized content in text, code, or other media.
Example: Comparing student assignments or research papers for similarity.

4. Image and Video Retrieval
Use Case: Searching for similar images or videos in large datasets.
Example: Reverse image search engines like Google Images.

LSH is particularly useful in scenarios where exact similarity search is computationally expensive or infeasible due to the high dimensionality of the data. It provides a scalable and efficient way to approximate similarity while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
